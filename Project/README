0. A Java SDK should be installed on your machine.  A JRE will not be
   enough for compiling the code.

1. Make a directory and unzip the file "monitor.zip" - you have
   probably done this already

   unix: prompt> mkdir ~/C653_Monitor
         prompt> mv monitor.zip ~/C653_Monitor
         prompt> cd ~/C653_Monitor
         prompt> unzip Monitor

   As a result there will be three directories named "Final," "Project,"
   and "logs" in ~/C653_Monitor.  Contents of these are as follows:

   Final: player data base (put there by a running monitor) "players.db"
          the monitor's RSA public key certificate "CACert"
          a file containing Diffie-Hellman parameters "DHKey"
          a file containing the monitor's RSA public key
          a file containing the monitor's RSA private key

   Project: java source for the entire monitor
            a file for updating the standings "stan_final_8150.run"
            two scripts for running a practice contest:
               "practice8150.run" - log is sent to file ../logs/practice.log
               "practice8150.withlog.run" - log is seen on console
            a script for running a final contest "final8150.run"

   logs: will contain practice.log, a log of a running practice contest
         and/or final.log, a log of a running final contest

2. Compile the java source - this may not be necessary
   
   unix: prompt> cd ~/C653_Monitor/Project
         prompt> javac *.java

   output should look like this only if compiling with Oracle's SDK:
     Note: Some input files use or override a deprecated API.
     Note: Recompile with -Xlint:deprecation for details.
     Note: Some input files use unchecked or unsafe operations.
     Note: Recompile with -Xlint:unchecked for details.

   note: javac may have to be replaced with /full-path-to-sdk/bin/javac
   in case of an error message saying javac is not found

3. Running a practice contest

   Inspect the file "practice8150.run" and edit as necessary.  The 
   following may need to be changed:

     nohup java:  if running in Windows, nohup should be removed
                  it may be necessary to replace "java" with the full 
                  path to java if you get an error message saying the
                  file java is not found

     8150: this is the port number that the monitor will be listening to.
           make this anything above 8000 if you want to change it.

     NEW: this means the old ../Final/players.db file will be replaced 
          with a fresh one - the fresh one is completely blank (no players).
          If the data base of a previous run is to be used, this should be
          replaced with RECOVER

     DYNAMIC: this means new players are added to the player database 
          as they log in.  If no new players will be allowed this should
          be changed to STATIC.  Typical operation calls for the practice
          contest parameters to be NEW DYNAMIC and if the monitor is 
          stopped it may be restarted with RECOVER DYNAMIC to pick up
          where it left off minus up to a 1 minute rewind due to the fact
          that the file "players.db" is updated once a minute.

4. Running a final contest

   Like running a practice contest except this is started using 
   "final8150.run"

   Note: for a final contest the parameters RECOVER STATIC are the 
   only ones that make sense.

5. Getting a DHKey file

   To create and install a DHKey file do this:

   unix: prompt> cd ~/C653_Monitor/Project
         prompt> java PlantDHKey
         prompt> cp DHKey ../Final
                  
6. Getting an RSA public/private key pair plus a certificate
   (files CACert, RSAPub, RSAPriv)

   unix: prompt> cd ~/C653_Monitor/CertAuthority
         prompt> java KeyMaker RSAPriv RSAPub CACert
         prompt> cp RSAPriv RSAPub CACert ../Final
